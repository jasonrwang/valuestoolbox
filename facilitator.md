Select the facilitators based on following:

1)Neutrality-Facilitator should be neutral to ensure that he/she does not pick any side during the discussion 

2)Active listening-Through paraphrasing and active listening, he/she must set tone for respectful and positive interaction and also perceive what needs to be brought in discussion if certain elements are missing

3)Value for diversity-The diverse stakeholders must feel an integral part of the discussion and a facilitator who values diversity can create a positive environment in which all stakeholders can freely express their opinion

4)Time management-It is important to effectively structure the perspective of different stakeholders in the limited time available and to steer the discussion towards the main topic in case it is diverging from it. This requires efficient time management on part of the facilitators
