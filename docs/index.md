# Values Deliberation Toolbox

Our societies often face complex problems where there are many differing views on how to resolve them. Sometimes, different individuals or groups might even have conflicting objectives for these problems. For example, high stakes policy programs like the energy transition and large infrastructure projects involve many stakeholders with a wide gamut of perspectives. We present a new (novel) methodology to accelerate the strategizing process by helping stakeholders understand each other’s values that they associate with different solutions to the problem.

Beyond more traditional approaches, research has shown that participants may cooperate if they understand each other’s values and why they prefer certain solutions. By discussing their values with one another, they may see more commonalities with each other or empathize for others’ concerns that they might have dismissed before. Our framework allows a facilitator to guide conflicting participants towards commonly agreeable strategies by encouraging a value-based discussion between the participants.

The process works best where there are distinct strategies and participants are willing to listen to, work with, and cooperate with one another.  The overall objective is for them to better understand each other and become more willing to cooperate.
